# Risk-Assessment
The purpose is to evaluate the comprehensive dependence structure and systematic risk between the prices of China oil future and energy stocks. To realize it, copula models are adopted to determine the average and tail dependence. Besides, this study employs copula functions to compute conditional value-at-risk to measure the systematic risk impacts of oil future price uncertainties on energy stocks returns.
