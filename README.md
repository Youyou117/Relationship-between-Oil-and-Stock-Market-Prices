# Risk-Assessment
The purpose is to evaluate the comprehensive dependence structure and systematic risk between the prices of China oil future and energy stocks. To realize it, copula models are adopted to determine the average and tail dependence. Besides, this study employs copula functions to compute conditional value-at-risk to measure the systematic risk impacts of oil future price uncertainties on energy stocks returns. 
The main steps are as follows.
•	Completed preliminary analysis of the time series data by summarizing statistics such as Skewness, kurtosis, Jarque-Bera test, ADF test, Ljung-Box and ARCH-LM statistics.
•	Estimated parameters of the marginal distributions to select adequate ARMA-GRACH models, and conducted K-S test to measure the goodness-of-fit of the models.
•	Forecasted with multiple feasible models, and compared their performance via information criterion such as AIC to select the best Copula for calculating conditional VaR.
